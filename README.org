* Generalized automatic execution in a single frame

This is a library that package developers can use to provide user
friendly single frame execution of buffer exposing commands, as well
as to use in personal emacs configurations to attain the same goal for
packages that don't use =fullframe= or the likes of it themself.

 Example:
 Open =magit-status= in a single window in fullscreen

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'fullframe)
  (fullframe magit-status magit-mode-quit-window :magit-fullframe nil)
#+END_SRC
