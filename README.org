* Generalized automatic execution at fullscreen 

This is a library that package developers can use to provide user
friendly fullscreen (that is full frame in emacs terminology)
execution of buffer exposing commands, as well as to use in personal
emacs configurations to attain the same goal for packages that don't
use =fullframe= or the likes of it themself.

 Example:
 Open =magit-status= in a single window in fullscreen

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'fullframe)
  (fullframe magit-status magit-mode-quit-window :magit-fullframe nil)
#+END_SRC
