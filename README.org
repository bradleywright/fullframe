* Generalized automatic execution at fullscreen 

This is a library that package developers can use to provide user
friendly fullscreen execution of buffer exposing commands, as well
as to use in personal emacs configurations to attain the same goal
for packages that don't use =efullscreen= themself.

 Example:
 Open =magit-status= in a single window in fullscreen

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'efullscreen)
  (efullscreen magit-status magit-mode-quit-window :magit-fullscreen nil)
#+END_SRC
